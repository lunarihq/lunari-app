# Privacy-focused period tracking app.

I'm building Lunari, a period tracking app designed to be a delight to use whilst preserving the usersâ€™ privacy by using local-only data storage. 

# Technologies used:
Lunari is being built using TypeScript with React Native to support both Android and iOS platforms, with local data storage handled via Drizzle ORM (SQLite).
